When writing react use as much NextUi components as possible, every module of the backend must be written in OOP following MVC pattern.
Entire project uses esm modules import syntax. DO NOT USE require.
ADD JSDOC TO EVERYTHING IN THE BACKEND(CLASSES, METHODS, ETC).

## Flow Overview

1. **Route Match**:
   - A user request (e.g., `GET /orders/:id`) triggers a specific controller method.

2. **Controller**:
   - Extracts and validates input from the request.
   - Delegates business logic to the **Service Layer**.

3. **Service Layer**:
   - Validates and processes data.
   - Coordinates repositories or external APIs to retrieve data.
   - Enforces business rules and logic.

4. **Repository Layer**:
   - Fetches raw data from the database.
   - Converts raw data into **Model** instances.

5. **Model Layer**:
   - Represents the application's domain entities.
   - Provides entity-specific methods (e.g., `calculateTotal()`).
   - Encapsulates logic related to individual entities.

6. **Back to Controller**:
   - The controller serializes the processed model data and sends it as an HTTP response.

## Interpretation of MVC

- **Repository**: The data layer, which interacts with the database.
- **Service**: Validates and processes data, coordinates repositories or external APIs to retrieve data, enforces business rules and logic.
- **Controller**: The presentation layer, validates and processes data from the request, and delegates the business logic to the service layer.
- **Model**: Domain entities, properties and methods specific to the entities.
- **View**: The presentation layer, Json responses to the client.
